%h3 What can we do for you?
%p
  Our main focus is Agile coaching with Scrum and
  %abbr{title: 'eXtreme Programming'} XP.
  For Web development we use Ruby on Rails combined with
  %abbr{title: 'Behaviour-driven Development'} BDD
  tools such as Cucumber. Cucumber ensures the acceptance tests can be read and created by
  anyone on the team: this helps explore and understand the requirements.
%p
  We can contribute to large projects but will consider working on prototypes to secure funding for your
  idea&mdash;perhaps for company stock.
%p
  We can provide Agile coaching, analysis, guidance on
  %abbr{title: 'eXtreme Programming'} XP
  techniques and seed your team with effective practices.
%p
  You can have your requirements gathered by an Agile analyst who knows how precise a specification needs to be
  before it can be converted into computer code, and can communicate with technical and non-technical audiences.
