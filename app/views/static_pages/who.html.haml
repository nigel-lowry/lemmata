%h1 Who are we?
%p
  I'm Nigel Lowry, Lemmata's company director and principal consultant.
%p
  I hold two degrees in computer science from

  and
  = succeed '.' do
    = link_to "Bristol", "http://www.bris.ac.uk/"
  These qualifications gave me insight into some of the hard problems in the field and formed the basis of my
  software engineering background.
  Before all that I was a history undergraduate and eventually found that, for me, computing was a much more
  creative pursuit.
%p
  I started my career on the
  %abbr{title: 'Ministry of Defence'} MOD's
  = link_to "graduate scheme for engineers and scientists", "https://www.gov.uk/defence-engineering-and-science-group/"
  becoming the project manager of an international procurement project within two years.
  Soon I missed the technical side of the job and went back to programming with
  = succeed '.' do
    = link_to "BAE Systems", "http://www.baesystems.com/"
%p
  Java certification is arguably the best-recognised and respected programming certification available today but
  after gaining the
  %abbr{title: 'Sun Certified Java Programmer'} SCJP
  and
  %abbr{title: 'Oracle Certified Master Java Developer'} OCMJD
  status I realised that enterprise Java development was just too difficult, costly and complicated so I began to
  look at other technologies.
%p
  For Web development, Ruby on Rails is hard to beat. It has testing support baked-in, which makes for quicker, more
  reliable development and I'm confident it can bring a lot of value to your project.
